# FlightDelay Interface

Flight Delay is a first decentralized application that provides insurance against flight delays or cancellations. The application is fully licensed, regulated, and operates on a public blockchain. If you flight is delayed by 45 minutes or more, the payout can be received immediately after the landing. There is no need to turn to an insurance company and go through endless paperwork. All you need is to check your email and follow simple instructions on how to get your refund. Never before has a flight delay been so satisfying!
